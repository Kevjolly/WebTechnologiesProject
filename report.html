	<h3><u>Starting the website:</u></h3>
	<p>Before starting the server, Elasticsearch needs to be downloaded:
		<ul>
			<li> Download and unzip Elasticsearch (VERSION 6.6.1!) <a href="https://www.elastic.co/cn/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-6-6-1">https://www.elastic.co/cn/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-6-6-1</a></li>
			<li> Run bin/elasticsearch (or bin\elasticsearch.bat on Windows)</li>
			<li> Now you can run the server (some node modules might be necessary). The website should now be available at localhost:8080. </li>
		</ul>
	Versions used: node v11.9.0, npm v6.5.0, elasticsearch v6-6-1.</p>

	<h3><u>Brief description of the website and work done:</u></h3>
	<p>TeamUp is a website where people can find projects to work in team. They can create a project and people can join those projects. They can also communicate with messages between each other.</p>

	<h3><u>Estimations with description:</u></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>C/B for HTML: Two pages of the website have been worked on, but the basic design of the website is done. Being used to using Bootstrap, we chose to take <a href= "https://materializecss.com/">Materialize.css</a> as the main framework to try something new. At the moment, this framework can be noticed with the navbar, the side navbar when rescaling, the search box, sign in, sign up and email verification boxes. A third page example.html serves as a test page to test out different functions from the server side.</li>
		<br>
		<li>C/B for CSS: Basic CSS has been done. The most noteworthy is the CSS about the background image and the box "Get Started" on the Home page.</li>
		<br>
		<li>A for JS: For instance, work has been done to ensure that information in the navbar is coherent with the side navbar when the window is resized (especially the search box). We can stress the work on boxes for sign in, sign up and email verification as well as checking that the inputs (password, mail) are correct. <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> was used to simplify JS coding. <a href="http://alasql.org/">Alasql</a> was used for the front-end storing of chat messages. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/">Firebase messaging sdk</a> is used to implement instant messaging and notification.
		<br>Client-side Javascript code is well encapsulated as SDKs such as instance messaging and user authentication. Also, advanced features like IndexedDB and service workers are used in the implemetation of instant messaging.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>X for PNG: Nothing has been done yet in this area. We want to add the choice for a user to add images to projects or to their profile which would give us the opportunity to work on the PNG part.</li>
		<br>
		<li>X for SVG: Nothing has been done yet in this area.</li>
		<br>
		<li>B/A for Server: Clearly structured code. Json Web Token (user session) validation. Using Firebase Cloud Messaging to implement instant messaging and notification. Plan to do cloud hosting and probably auto-testing using Selenium.</li>
		<br>
		<li>A for Database: Instead of tranditional SQL databases, Elasticsearch is chosen for this project. The reason is for the project to work properly, search engine is a vital functionality. Thus, Elasticsearch is used for both indexing documents and data storage. In order to meet different search requirements, different indexing strategies are required for different entities and different properties. Database related code is organised into a separate module using singleton pattern to better manage connections.</li>
		<br>
		<li>X for Dynamic pages: Work not done yet. We plan to use a combination of client-side rendering (instant messaging notably) and server-side rendering (for most of the rest). We plan to use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache">Mustache.js</a> for our template rendering engine.</li>
		<br>
		<li>B for Depth: A large part of the server side has been done and the front-end was started. As we had already worked on projects with traditionnal SQL databases or frameworks like Bootstrap, we decided to try to use a new framework like for instance Materialize.css for the front-end and Elasticsearch for the database. Therefore, part of the time was spent learning about those frameworks.We are particularly proud of the instant messaging with notifications system and the search engine on the server side.</li>
