		<h1>Web Technologies Project Report</h1>
		<hr>
		<h3><u>Pair:</u>
			<i>
				<ul>
					<li>Kévin Jolly, Candidate N° 97249</li>
					<li>Ren Jiang, Candidate N° 97247</li>
				</ul>
			</i>
		</h3>

	<hr>
	<h3><u>Starting the website:</u></h3>
	<ul>
		<li> Unzip the Elasticsearch bundle</li>
		<li> Run bin/elasticsearch (or bin\elasticsearch.bat on Windows)</li>
		<li> Run <i>npm install</i> to install dependencies</li>
		<li> Run <i>node site</i> and the website should now be available at localhost:8081. </li>
		<li> <b>For messaging functionalities to work, notification permission should be granted.</b></li>
	</ul>
	Versions used: node v11.9.0, npm v6.5.0, elasticsearch v6-6-1.</p>
	<hr>

	<h3><u>Cloud hosted version</u></h3>
	The site is also hosted on <a href="http://teamup-env.qck29pusvr.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/">AWS Elastic
		Beanstalk</a>. However, because instant messaging uses service workers which require https environments, hosted
	site does not support messaging or notification.
	<b>To test messaging and notification, a local application needs to be set up.</b>
	<hr>

	<h3><u>Brief description of the website and work done:</u></h3>
	<p>TeamUP is a website where people can find projects to work in team. They can create a project and people can join
		those projects. They can also communicate with messages between each other.</p>
	<hr>

	<h3><u>Estimations with description:</u></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>C/B for HTML: Two pages of the website have been worked on, but the basic design of the website is done.
			Being used to using Bootstrap, we chose to take <a href="https://materializecss.com/">Materialize.css</a> as
			the main framework to try something new. At the moment, this framework can be noticed with the navbar, the
			side navbar when rescaling, the search box, sign in, sign up and email verification boxes. A third page
			example.html serves as a test page to test out different functions from the server side.</li>
		<br>
		<li>C/B for CSS: Basic CSS has been done. The most noteworthy is the CSS about the background image and the box
			"Get Started" on the Home page.</li>
		<br>
		<li>A for JS: For instance, work has been done to ensure that information in the navbar is coherent with the
			side navbar when the window is resized (especially the search box). We can stress the work on boxes for sign
			in, sign up and email verification as well as checking that the inputs (password, mail) are correct. <a
				href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> was used to simplify JS coding. <a
				href="http://alasql.org/">Alasql</a> was used for the front-end storing of chat messages. <a
				href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/">Firebase messaging sdk</a> is used to implement
			instant messaging and notification.
			<br>Client-side Javascript code is well encapsulated as SDKs such as instance messaging and user
			authentication. Also, advanced features like IndexedDB and service workers are used in the implementation of
			instant messaging.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>A for PNG: Original artworks are created. A <a href="png/gavin">cartoon portrait</a> is created from an
			original photo inspired by a
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbtukN4o1Hw">tutorial</a>. A <a href="png/pokeball/">pokeball</a>
			is created following an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvmiCxXnPTc">tutorial</a> using features
			like shape tools,
			gradient tools, airbrush, etc. An <a href="png/scene">original artwork</a> is created using images from the
			internet and the
			pokeball we have done.</li>
		<br>
		<li>A for SVG: Original site logo and favicon designed using <a
				href="http://www.drawsvg.org/drawsvg.html">drawsvg</a>. Features such as shape tools, transformation and
			gradient are used.</li>
		<br>
		<li>A for Server: Clearly structured code. Json Web Token (user session) validation. XSS protection middleware.
			Using Firebase Cloud Messaging to implement instant messaging and notification. <a
				href="http://teamup-env.qck29pusvr.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/">Cloud hosting</a> using AWS
			Beanstalk.</li>
		<br>
		<li>A for Database: Instead of traditional SQL databases, Elasticsearch is chosen for this project. The reason
			is for the project to work properly, search engine is a vital functionality. Thus, Elasticsearch is used for
			both indexing documents and data storage. In order to meet different search requirements, different indexing
			strategies are required for different entities and different properties. Database related code is organised
			into a separate module using singleton pattern to better manage connections. Security is guaranteed using
			https and username password authentication.</li>
		<br>
		<li>X for Dynamic pages: Work not done yet. We plan to use a combination of client-side rendering (instant
			messaging notably) and server-side rendering (for most of the rest). We plan to use <a
				href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache">Mustache.js</a> for our template rendering engine.</li>
		<br>
		<li>B for Depth: A large part of the server side has been done and the front-end was started. As we had already
			worked on projects with traditionnal SQL databases or frameworks like Bootstrap, we decided to try to use a
			new framework like for instance Materialize.css for the front-end and Elasticsearch for the database.
			Therefore, part of the time was spent learning about those frameworks.We are particularly proud of the
			instant messaging with notifications system and the search engine on the server side.</li>
	</ul>

	TO ADD:
	- got inspired for chat box by https://bootsnipp.com/materialize/snippets/lVBkM but changed it
	- messaging doesn't work if you're not connected
